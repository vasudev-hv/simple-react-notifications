# Notification Assignment
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and leverages react-md library to implement the notification system.

The project covers the following usecases:
* As a user, I should be able to view number of pending notifications to be read.
* As a user, I should be able to click on the notification icon and expand the view to
see a list of notifications
* As a user, I should be able to make out from the UI, read and unread
notifications.
* As a user, I should be able to mark all notifications read
* As a developer, I should be able to configure actions for notifications, so that,
when a user clicks on notification, he is taken to a different page/
* As a developer, I should be able to configure the look and feel of the notification
Widget (think in terms of color, themes etc...)
